I've been overhauling our (many) quest systems to reduce dev time, plugin points, and data duplication to create and maintain quests.","","One (of many) factors of that is that if we wanted an in-world breadcrumb trail and hint arrow to the start of a quest, this needed to be manually coded as an exception in the task system (which is partially deprecated by the new achievement system).","","The \"Start of <quest name>\" worldmap marker you describe is also currently a static mapelement that the quest developer needs to configure to specifically appear for their quest (in addition to separate mapelements for the quest start and in progress icons, not to mention all that blue box highlighting of objectives throughout the quest).","","When/if this system overhaul goes out, I've decoupled and automated that process so when you set a quest to active at not started state, it'll generate a trail and map marker automatically and dynamically, and take into account routing coordinates to interior mapsquares.","","One less thing a developer has to do (or forget to do, or redo if the quest giver moves during development) so they can spend that time on the quest.","","To answer your question more practically, it's because we have a lot more content developer functionality available on the world map.","","The minimap is a layer with a custom ID on which the engine renders the nearby terrain.","","There are some commands we can send to the minimap, like the position of a hintarrow on the minimap, but the engine takes care of rendering it. There's very little a content developer can do to manipulate the minimap.","","The worldmap has more content-side customisation features and its UI is mostly written in RuneScript. That \"Start of <quest name>\" is a mapelement we can dynamically apply to a coordinate on the worldmap, but the minimap is a closed system that doesn't render those components.","","It's why for example minimap icons don't display hover tooltips or map labels like on the worldmap.","","That's the sort of feature that would have to be added to the minimap by engine developers, who have higher priorities like improving the NXT client, asset pipeline and mobile support."],"source":{"news":null,"reddit":{"comments":[{"type":"comment","subreddit":"runescape","threadId":"86rgn4","commentId":"dw7ciyz","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/86rgn4/why_does_set_active_for_a_quest_put_a_marker_on/dw7ciyz/","title":"Why does \"Set Active\" for a quest put a marker on the world map but not minimap?

It even convinced me, I took the job expecting it to take me inside a day, but it turned into much more than that (it took me about 5 days of solid work or so in the end). ","","Why Mod Kieren? Why does it take so long to add left click cooking? Well, I’m going to try to explain the infrastructure we used to have and the infrastructure we have now. ","","Before this update, the only way to cook was to use your raw item on the range/fire. This is super useful for us, as it provides us information directly – we know straight away exactly which item you’d like to cook. Mostly that means we just need to ask you how many you want to make and proceed into the core cooking process. We then pass data into the cooking system relevant to the item you’re trying to cook. ","","https://cdn.runescape.com/assets/img/external/oldschool/2018/newsposts/2018-09-14/kieren5.png","","In the process mentioned there, ~cooking_getquantity asks you how many you’d like to make, and assuming you want to make at least 1, we pass data into the system – these are all the things we need to know, such as what item it turns into when you succeed, when you fail, what messages to give, how much experience to give, what are the chances of success etc. ","","Now the problem is… when left clicking on the range, I don’t know which item you’re trying to cook. You could have 25 steel bars, a raw trout, a raw salmon and a raw lobster in your inventory. I need a way to know that firstly, the steel bars aren’t cookable, and put together a choice screen for you to choose from the items that are. That code above isn’t very helpful for that, it’s all written out long hand inside the trigger for using an item on a range. To make matters worse, it’s written out in three different places! The trigger for using items on the Lumbridge Range, fires and then other ranges. They each offer slightly different chances of success, fires use different animations, and certain items can only be cooked on fires or ranges! ","","Whilst the Lumbridge Range is known for supplying slightly decreased burn rates, it only applies to a small subset of all cookable items, and the Cooking Gauntlets are similar too, adding further complications. ","","The ideal situation, would be a centralised piece of code which is used for fires and all ranges alike – giving the appropriate restrictions and chances as above. There are still two types of interaction though following this update…left click ‘Cooking’ and using a raw item on the cooking device. In one situation, I know what raw item you want to cook, and in the other I need to compile a list of items you could cook from the items in your inventory. Writing data in two places leads to mistakes and extra work for adding future cookable items. This led to the tedious task of converting it all to use a data structure system. ","","https://cdn.runescape.com/assets/img/external/oldschool/2018/newsposts/2018-09-14/struct.png","","These are what we call structs, they’re simply an entity that stores data. There are two sets of structs:","","There’s a struct for the ‘raw items’, this contains information about the raw object, what it can turn into, level requirements to cook it, restrictions on cooking it on fires or ranges, text for certain messaging etc.","","There’s then a struct for the ‘cooked items’, this contains information about cooking that particular item, what are the chances of cooking it (on ranges, on fires, on the lumbridge range, and on cooking gauntlets potentially!).","","This should store all of the information we need to know about cooking that raw into that product – it is a combination of those long hand written out sets of data you saw above from cooking on fires, lumbridge ranges and all other ranges. ","","Now I can much more readily read this data in multiple places! When you use an item, I can verify it’s a cookable item by checking if it has one of these structs associated with it. When you use the new left click cook option, I can check your whole inventory for items that fit the bill too! Now the make-x system does only allow 10 options, so I have to limit it to the first 10 potential products I find in your inventory – but hey, I think that’s going to cover anyone’s culinary desires.

It should be easy hiding spells that you don't have the level or runes to cast, right? Similarly, switching to bigger icons if there aren't many remaining should be straightforward. \"If the spell needs law runes, and you have no law runes, don't draw it, and if there are only ~20 icons remaining, draw them all bigger.\"","","The problem was that the game never had a look-up table that could do the check.","","It's a legacy code thing. Back in 2004 when RuneScape 2 came out, runescript didn't have all the features it does today, especially when it comes to look-up tables and data structures (see what a decade of engine work gets you). So data tended to be written into the code directly, and that's how it continued. In this example from Varrock Teleport, the code would check for level 25 and abort if you hadn't got it. Then it'd check for the specified runes, and abort if you hadn't got those.","","https://cdn.runescape.com/assets/img/external/oldschool/2018/newsposts/2018-10-04/spellbook_rewrite_1.png","","It was the same for the spellbook interface. When the Varrock Teleport button loaded, it would run some code, passing in the GFX, the level requirement, the name and description, and the runes, so that when a player hovered over the spell they'd have a tooltip generated to show that info. The code could generate tooltips but it couldn't do anything else.","","https://cdn.runescape.com/assets/img/external/oldschool/2018/newsposts/2018-10-04/spellbook_rewrite_2.png","","Spells with multiple forms would have all this data written into all the code versions separately. For example, Weaken had the level and rune checks written into its PvM version and also into its PvP version, and these had to match whatever was written into the spellbook interface. For spells that could be autocast, the level and rune checks were written out yet again, so the game could check whether you should be allowed to set that spell for autocasting.","","That doesn't work very well for this filter update. \"If the spell needs law runes, and you have no law runes, don't draw it...\" - but none of the code described above would be able to do that. We'd got code on the server that could decide whether or not to cast the spell, and code on the client that could decide how to draw a tooltip, but none of these could make the spellbook interface decide not to show the icon at all, nor shuffle the remaining icons into a grid.","","For this update, we had the choice of doing a quickie job by writing a separate bit of code that would run the level & rune checks for each spell to hide them, shuffling the remaining icons into a grid. That wouldn't take long, but it would have left us with yet another piece of code with the data duplicated into it. We decided to do a more thorough job.","","Each spell now has a data structure, listing all its core attributes. We can now refer to this directly from any piece of code, both on the server and client. The same data can now be read by:","","Attempting to cast a spell on an NPC.","Attempting to cast a spell on a player.","Setting up the tooltip on the spellbook interface.","Deciding whether to show the spell on the spellbook interface, and rearranging other spells accordingly.","Attempting to choose the spell for autocasting.","Setting up the tooltip on the autocast interface.","Any kinds of future update, such as offering the info on the skill-guide...","","https://cdn.runescape.com/assets/img/external/oldschool/2018/newsposts/2018-10-04/spellbook_rewrite_3.png","","The data entry took over a week due to all the oddities of various spells. Oddly enough, rewriting the code of the spellbook interface to read this data instead of what it had before, and to generate its layout accordingly, took only a day - albeit a day with quite a late night in the office. A further day (and late night) was spent building in a filter menu for Mobile users, and gave them an option for bringing up the tooltip on mobile devices, which they previously couldn't.","","That just left us to rewrite the server code for each spell to read this data too. There are 176 spells (counting Home Teleport and Bounty Teleport on each spellbook where they appear) so that was a rather large job, especially as any error would likely lead to serious bugs. This took over a week. While we were editing each spell, we also moved the 'combat delay' code slightly in each one, so that if you try to cast a spell for which you don't have the runes, you won't be 'delayed' from casting more spells - that might be handy for those of us without pinpoint clicking precision.","","Some unrelated code needed rewriting too. The Great Olm's fires can be extinguished by water spells, and the code for those needed editing to use this data so that it stays reasonably maintainable. Similarly the spell tablet creation process uses this data, both for POH tablets and the Arceuus ones.","","Once all that was done, the testers were able to begin checking each spell individually. Over the course of about 3 weeks, each spell was checked for:","","Level requirement.","Rune requirements.","Rune deletion.","F2P/members availability (taking into account that some spells are permitted specially in LMS).","Combat delay against an NPC.","Combat delay against a player.","Autocast handling.","Spell tablets.","","Unfortunately, the final thing to be checked was the F2P/members availability. That turned out to be where the most severe bug was found during testing - an engine feature being used to read this data turned out not to handle members' data correctly on F2P. It turned out that we'd not used that bit of the engine in this way before, and hadn't encountered this problem with it. So, with that critical bug being found this week, we've had to push the spellbook update back to next week (Thursday 11th October). Your continued patience is very much appreciated.","","To desktop users, the spellbook ultimately doesn't look much changed, other than that we fixed the inconsistent column spacing on the Ancient spellbook, and listed the spell ingredients in a more consistent order throughout. But under the hood there's been a vast amount of maintenance done over the last few weeks. Maybe that's not a benefit for players now, but in the game's future it really should be.","","As you'll have gathered, there's a lot of scope for error in a rewrite of this scale. Incorrect transcription of data could lead to spells requiring the wrong runes or levels. Incorrect adaptation of the spell code could lead to spells having no combat delay (enabling 1-tick spellcasting), or deleting the runes off you twice, or even just crashing you offline. We've worked very hard on to get the data correct and to check each aspect of each spells individually, but with a project this size, there's a real likelihood of something being wrong somewhere.","","If you do run into problems, just right-click the Report button in the game (or long-press it if you're on Mobile) to find the bug report form, where you can let the testers know quickly and conveniently. And thanks for your patience while we invest in making the OSRS codebase more manageable for the future!","","- Mod Ash "],"source":{"news":[{"articleSlug":"master-clue-reward-and-quality-of-life-changes","url":"https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/a=62/master-clue-reward-and-quality-of-life-changes?oldschool=1","title":"Master Clue Reward and Quality of Life Changes"}],"reddit":null,"tweet":null,"wiki":[{"articleSlug":"Update:Master_Clue_Reward_and_Quality_of_Life_Changes","url":"https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Update:Master_Clue_Reward_and_Quality_of_Life_Changes","title":"Update:Master Clue Reward and Quality of Life Changes"}],"youtube":null},"media":{"images":[{"matched":"180.spellbook_rewrite_1.png","leakId":180,"subLeakLabel":"spellbook_rewrite_1","extension":"png","textLines":null},{"matched":"180.spellbook_rewrite_2.png","leakId":180,"subLeakLabel":"spellbook_rewrite_2","extension":"png","textLines":null},{"matched":"180.spellbook_rewrite_3.png","leakId":180,"subLeakLabel":"spellbook_rewrite_3","extension":"png","textLines":null}],"videos":[]},"meta":{"links":[{"domain":"secure.runescape.com","url":"https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/a=62/master-clue-reward-and-quality-of-life-changes?oldschool=1"},{"domain":"oldschool.runescape.wiki","url":"https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Update:Master_Clue_Reward_and_Quality_of_Life_Changes"},{"domain":"cdn.runescape.com","url":"https://cdn.runescape.com/assets/img/external/oldschool/2018/newsposts/2018-10-04/spellbook_rewrite_1.png"},{"domain":"cdn.runescape.com","url":"https://cdn.runescape.com/assets/img/external/oldschool/2018/newsposts/2018-10-04/spellbook_rewrite_2.png"},{"domain":"cdn.runescape.com","url":"https://cdn.runescape.com/assets/img/external/oldschool/2018/newsposts/2018-10-04/spellbook_rewrite_3.png"}],"postedAt":"2018-10-04T07:00:00.000Z"},"numFiles":3},{"leakId":181,"text":["https://twitter.com/JagexSova/status/879661753579319296","https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DDUvaxWXsAANM5p.jpg","27 Jun 2017","","---","","It's quite easy to miss, but I did manage to put some inconsequential dialogue on the \"filler\" NPCs in #Menaphos based on rep / quests"],"source":{"news":null,"reddit":null,"tweet":[{"handle":"jagexsova","tweetId":"879661753579319296","url":"https://twitter.com/JagexSova/status/879661753579319296"}],"wiki":null,"youtube":null},"media":{"images":[{"matched":"181.0.jpg","leakId":181,"subLeakLabel":"0","extension":"jpg","textLines":null}],"videos":[]},"meta":{"links":[{"domain":"twitter.com","url":"https://twitter.com/JagexSova/status/879661753579319296"},{"domain":"pbs.twimg.com","url":"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DDUvaxWXsAANM5p.jpg"}],"postedAt":"2017-06-27T07:00:00.000Z"},"numFiles":1},{"leakId":182,"text":["https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/891995293138513920","31 Jul 2017","","---","",".mesanim is for chathead expressions such as 'happy', 'evillaugh', etc. .mes (renamed to .enum) is for look-up tables. .param = parameters."],"source":{"news":null,"reddit":null,"tweet":[{"handle":"jagexash","tweetId":"891995293138513920","url":"https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/891995293138513920"}],"wiki":null,"youtube":null},"media":{"images":[],"videos":[]},"meta":{"links":[{"domain":"twitter.com","url":"https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/891995293138513920"}],"postedAt":"2017-07-31T07:00:00.000Z"},"numFiles":0},{"leakId":183,"text":["https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/569561056177225728","https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B-d8wvXCMAAiuH-.png","22 Feb 2015","","---","","This item definition file just brightened my afternoon - behold the rare Left-handed Banana of @OldSchoolRS!"],"source":{"news":null,"reddit":null,"tweet":[{"handle":"jagexash","tweetId":"569561056177225728","url":"https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/569561056177225728"}],"wiki":null,"youtube":null},"media":{"images":[{"matched":"183.0.png","leakId":183,"subLeakLabel":"0","extension":"png","textLines":null}],"videos":[]},"meta":{"links":[{"domain":"twitter.com","url":"https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/569561056177225728"},{"domain":"pbs.twimg.com","url":"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B-d8wvXCMAAiuH-.png"}],"postedAt":"2015-02-22T08:00:00.000Z"},"numFiles":1},{"leakId":184,"text":["https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/560494486238003200","https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B8dGw8UIgAAggTB.png","28 Jan 2015","","---","","Work starts on the Collection Box menu for the @OldSchoolRS GE.

October 2018","","---","","Wise Old Man","","This change has been highly requested and was met with a resounding Yes in the poll. The Wise Old man's ability to spot redundant non-member quest items in your bank has been rewritten. The feature now includes member's quests and uses a handy interface for discarding items directly so you can keep the ones you want! The Remove All button prompts you with a confirmation screen before removing all of the items shown in the interface.","","https://cdn.runescape.com/assets/img/external/oldschool/2018/newsposts/2018-10-11/wom.png","","This update required a large amount of data gathering work to be done to ensure that the Wise Old Man could remove all the quest items properly. Firstly, the current code infrastructure had to be rewritten, this was because although the Wise Old Man was checking your bank for the Free to Play quest items previously, he would only tell you that you had them and not remove them.","","https://cdn.runescape.com/assets/img/external/oldschool/2018/newsposts/2018-10-11/wom_1.png","","This system of checking the items would also not be suitable for Members’ quest items, as there are so many more of them to check compared to the Free to Play quest items. The first step in checking which Members’ quest items that the player has was to create a list of every single item that is used in Members’ quests. ","","To do this I manually went through the items that we have from each quest and put them into their own data structure for each quest. This was a tedious task as there were initially about two and a half thousand quest items that needed to be sorted through! I managed to cut this down to the items which could potentially be an issue and then store this information into a data structure for easy reference.","","https://cdn.runescape.com/assets/img/external/oldschool/2018/newsposts/2018-10-11/wom_2.png","","This is what we call an enum, they are a way in which we pass through a certain value and then output another value corresponding to it. This easily allowed me to keep a list of items for each quest, and then I can only display those items if you have them and have finished the quest.","","Once this information was sorted and stored into the data structures I then had to check which quests the player had completed so that they could only remove the items once the quest is finished.

There are also some annoyances with using the banking system that would be greatly sped up if the verifying was done passively (i.e would happen instantly on our end, but if the servers detecting something illegal it would change it back).","","**Would it be possible to tone this down?","**How hard is it to have a game tick running constantly?","**Is the game tick affected when the server lags because of heavy load?","","- The game was originally 100% server side on launch in 2004. Since then we've added a client side scripting system and improvements to the interface system which allows the content team to move responses to the client where it's safe to do so. Newer content is generally better at this, but we still keep a lot of restrictions in place (as you see). The reason for this is simply that it allows us to keep the security at the engine level without having to worry the content team about client/server security - they can get on with making great content!","","There's a fairly noticable delay between clicking something and it actually happening (kinda brings it back to my first question).","","**How much extra load would be added to the servers if the duration of a tick was halfed or thirded, would we ever see decrease in time between ticks?","","- Well, twice, three times etc! Actually, our engine was tweaked to run at 10x its current rate for Stellar Dawn, and that worked OK - the main problem is that we'd break a LOT of content doing it.","","**What's the current biggest character filesize? How much memory does an active character use?","","- Save games are a few kilobytes generally, memory on the server will again be a few 10s of kilobytes and 100s of K on the client for the models, sounds etc","","**How insightful has the hiring of Mod Jacmob been? In an interview (no source) I read he was pretty confident all bots could be stopped, is this still the case? ","","- He's great to work with and has been very busy working on the anti botting.","","---","","Why is there a bank space limit? Is it due to server space? ","","Yes, simple as that. Every (Stack of) item you have uses 6 bytes of server space, so do the maths!","","---","","are there new features in Java7 that you are looking forward to, do you know when the Java7 will finish beta and mature, will the Java7 be as available as java6 to all the existing players and do you have plan to make something exclusive for Java7","Is the development of the game hindered by some delay in Java development(past and now and future)? Do you have any roadmap or plans to keep pace with the latest technology","","- Java 7 doesn't really provide us with anything extra we can use in RuneScape. In reality, we are locked to the minimum version we support (6, update 10), anything new we want we write ourselves on top of this base.","","What is your view towards DirectX 11?","some games used the DirectX 11 code path to increase the fps while keeping the same gfx detail, more and more devices are going to support DirectX 11, like next gen iGPU of Intel and SoCs of tablets, is there any such plan for future like 2013, 2014?","","- Again, we have to support DX9 as our base. Whilst we could have a DX11 gfx mode, so few people could use it at the moment that it wouldn't be worth the time, sorry.","","In the last Q&A, you said there was a new engine in development that render objects progressively with increasing detail from far to near, that there will be no \"loading, please wait\", how are they now?","","- Still working on it, sorry!","","i've heard that Transformers Universe and stellar dawn will use a“new Runescape engine\", so will that be used in Runescape in the future, are you working together? and will it or at least some be used on RS in the future, how big the differences will be? ( can you ans by avoiding telling what they are like)","","- It is unlikely RS will be ported to the TU engine as they've grown very far apart. That doesn't mean that RS won't get engine upgrades, just that they will likely come from a different source.","","Java is dying?? Will the future mainstream consumer products no longer support Java, like the Android and iOS now, I’ve heard that future browser will no longer support plugin, and do you plan to make Runescape available to tablets?","","- Yes, it is. We have plans, watch this space!","","What will next gen engine be if there is one","Will you increase the system requirement in the future. And what you think the future requirement will like","","- We never plan to increase system reqs unless completely necessary. We don't have any plans for this at the moment, certainly.","","What restrictions you are facing now due to Java ","","- Not really Java, but its deployment to PCs grows less all the time and persuading people to install it gets harder and harder :(","","---","","you said performance cant scale up with MC support, so what is the cause, what you will do ?","","- It's down the architecture of the RT5 engine - it wasn't designed for multi core, and retro fitting it broke many things. Whilst I have it working in my test builds, it's both unstable and not appreciably faster because of this. A new architecture of course won't have this problem!","","There are some games for tablets having better graphics and higher fps than Runescape, like the Infinity Blade(if I have remembered corectly), has crytek engine and its graphics is really good, and is very smooth as well What do you think?","","- Yes! We want to emulate and surpass what is possible in the browser - we have major updates planned to bring us back in line with other titles. Watch this space.","","The game engine even before bot nuke is not efficient, what do you plan to do to improve it","","- Optimus will address many of these issues. Other than that, a brand new graphics architecture is required.","","I heard pc with AMD gpu are more prone to fps issue even before the bot nuke, what do you think?","","- It's certainly possible. We generally develop on nVidia GPUs (historically ATI cards have had serious reliability problems with drivers), but we are allocating ATI cards out to some developers now to catch these problems.","","The system requirement and GPU comparison is out of date, any plan to update it?? What spec do you think an average fps of 30+ with all high except no AA in openGL or direct will need if the engine is efficient?","","- I don't know for sure, but as I mentioned earlier my 4-5 year old PC runs RS at a solid 30-40 fps at the moment.","","People tend to get very low fps in crowded area no matter how good their pc is, what is the cause and how will you improve it? ","","- Turn off 'idle anims: all', other than that it's because of our animation architecture. We know it sucks and plan to improve it!","","---","","Does the Runescape currently take full advantage of computers with multi core processors? And if not, are there any restrictions preventing you doing so?","And do you have any plans to use OpenCL (or similar software such as CUDA) in the future? ","","- No, yes, and see previous answer about the RT5 architecture. Not enough people have decent OpenCL support to make it worthwhile yet, sorry!","","---","","My questions for the team:","","1: What are your plans for the next RuneTek Engine? It's been three years since RuneTek 5 was released (AKA: SD/HD Combo update) and two years ago you released a early preview of it in one of your trailers, so we must be due for it soon.","","- RT 6 is the TU engine. RT 7 (for RS) is being designed at the moment.","","2: What are the estimated performance boosts expected for Optimus? How many frames will we be able to claw back? ","","- I don't have exact figures, but hopefully back to around where we were pre-nuke.","","---","","4. Adbots are on the rise, and I have personally been reporting every single one that I find, pm's me or otherwise shows their spamming nuisance. What is being done to combat these RWT adbots? ","","Before we launched ChatWatch, there was an average of 250,000 adverts in game each day. Now that figure is under 10,000.","","This is still being worked on currently to constantly improve this system. So in order to help us, please continue to report any of these you see in game, it really does help.","","Thanks :)","","---","","1) Recent FPS issues have lead some to question whether Java is showing its limits in the game. Do you believe that's true? Have you ever felt like Java really limited the expansion of the game or engine?","","- Java doesn't really limit us speed wise, just deployment wise, as I think I mentioned earlier.","","2) What's the hardest project you've had to work on to date?","","- Introducing full UV texturing into the java renderer - ARGH","","3) Out of all of you in that room, who would win in a fight? ;)","","- Mike, probably. Although if the fight involved MahJong tiles, probably Phil.","","---","","Hi game engine team :)","","1) Would Jagex ever consider releasing the tools used to create the game for game developers (like myself) to see how they work?","","- Maybe, but I think they'd probably scare you off to see the madness we make the content teams deal with!","","2) Which other programming languages would you say runescript was similar to? Could we have a code snippet? ;)","","- Hmm, syntax wise it's similar to any C-style language, except variable names are prefixed with their type (eg. %varname is an integer). We also lack full array support. Other than that, it'd do pretty much anything you could do in C or Java.","","3) What is the biggest piece of advice you would give to people who want to get into the games industry? ","","- As mentioned earlier, maths, maths and maths.","","---","","To Chris_E and Michael:","Bank space is something you seem reluctant to increase. I hear the reason is because of the increasing size of the game save file for each player. If each bank space is represented by two 32 bit numbers (item ID and stack number) and there are probably less than 40k item IDs in use, why not reduce the space allocation for the item ID variable and increase the amount of bank space we can have. ","-","Actually we use a 16bit and 32it number, but close enough - recently we went over 16bits for location and models IDs :(","","---","","@ Engine Team - Any possibility players may ever be able to see what they're account ID number is in the system?","","I think some players would be curious to know what number out of the vast majority their account is. :P Again not really a pressing question.","","- For historic reasons we don't have incrementing account IDs. For players with username logins, these names are hashed into the account ID, for email login players we auto generate a random one.","","---","","Hi iluminator5:","","\"1) Will Skyboxes be implemented into the main game world anytime soon?\"","","That's up to our content team - the engine will do them, they just need to design some. :)","","2) Is Runetek 6 coming anytime soon?

And the answer is: when it's ready. ;)","","---","","Purus Feles:","","\"To whoever can explain this.","","Many people \"flame\" fellow players who complain about the fps problems.","","The most common is that those who complain are told that they have crappy computers and should buy new stuff etc.","","But...unless I misread (in tech support)...I read something about the game-engine being part of the problem and that there appears to be a (fps) problem with RS running on (some) computer(s) with more then 1 processor.","","Can this whole fps problem be explained in complete honesty and in such a way that its clear for the \"dumbies\" as well?","","(perhaps by creating a \"fps problem explanation guide for dumbies\" thread...as we are not all \"computer specialists\";)\"","","===","","There are several things that add up to cause the frame rate issues. The underlying issue is historical. When RuneScape was first written (before HD), it was a purely software based graphics engine. That means that all of the work was done on your CPU, rather than on your graphics card. This is good in some ways and bad in others. It meant that RuneScape would run (slowly) on any computer, regardless of what graphics hardware you have. It did however mean that the graphics were a bit rubbish.","","When HD was introduced, we moved to having 4 ways to render the graphics:","- Pure Java (now called Safe Mode). This is the slowest way to see the game (I can't really emphasise this enough, as people seem to think it is faster), but it will always work, if the other methods don't work for you. You should never need to choose this, which is why there is no button for it in the graphics options","","- Software mode. This also does not use the graphics card, but it works by running some native code (i.e. not Java) written a mixture of C++, assembly and intrinsics in order to provide an experience that is faster that safe mode, but also does not need any particular graphics drivers to be installed. This is generally the best way to play on netbooks, and other low-end devices","","- OpenGL and DirectX. These two are the hardware modes, and are generally the best way to play RuneScape. However, the problem that exists with this is that the software mode was written first. When writing graphics code to run on graphics cards, you have to write it in a very different way to how you would write it to have a software rasteriser. As our hardware modes are grafted into the existing engine, they are not quite so efficient as they might be. When we obfuscate this code, any slowdown this causes is magnified, which has caused the slowdown since the bot update. The underlying issue is difficult for us to solve, but it is certainly something we keep on coming up with ideas to deal with, and we have plans that should mitigate this to some degree.

Where do we start? Well the first thing we need to do is to break it down into bitesize chunks. For this, we use a software package called JIRA.","","http://cdn.runescape.com/assets/img/external/oldschool/2017/newsposts/2017-05-03/jira-jobs.png","","I cannot just go and \"develop The Inferno\" - what components are required for it?","","These tasks then need to have dependencies set out, for example we cannot tie in the time-tracking feature until we have the actual wave system and minigame up and running - at least in some capacity.","","Selection of JIRA jobs","","We prioritise features based on how vital they are to the update, and how many dependencies they have. For example, the wave structure is vital for so much of the content that we really need that in place ASAP before moving on to creating the final boss even.","","http://cdn.runescape.com/assets/img/external/oldschool/2017/newsposts/2017-05-03/jira-icons.png","","A lot of extraneous features we associate with being \"nice to have\" if we get enough time. On a typical project, we make a rather large list of features in this category, and cut them back throughout development to the ones we feel are best and have time to develop.","","An interesting aspect to this is we poll many of these things, such as Lava eel fishing in Mor Ul Rek. This means it is vital to the update - since we've promised it is going to happen!","","http://cdn.runescape.com/assets/img/external/oldschool/2017/newsposts/2017-05-03/lava-eels.png","","Once that's all sorted, I could start laying some code down and get the main systems in place. Most of this was straight forward, as obviously TzHaar Fight Caves has a pretty similar minigame going on - but one thing I managed to tie into the core system, was purely randomised spawns.","","A player shouldn't be able to determine where monsters are going to be spawned, but at the same time, these locations are saved per run! This means they cannot logout and in to get more desired spawn locations for the monsters.","","http://cdn.runescape.com/assets/img/external/oldschool/2017/newsposts/2017-05-03/spawns-runescript.png","","This is Runescript: our in-house scripting language. The code shown here is what runs when you first enter the Inferno.","","---","","Now acquiring assets from graphics, we were able to start visualising how this would all look, and this is where the back and forth happened a fair bit. Animations and timings are notoriously tricky to get right in RuneScript!","","I'd fix one thing, and discover we needed to tweak an animation and this happened several times before we were all incredibly pleased with the final product!

The map editing tool we use to build the world of OSRS had some worldmap functionality - it allowed you to scroll around the world and click an area to load the relevant map file, which is a bit easier than having to remember which file contains which bit of the world. It could also export the surface world to a big .png file, which is what we use to keep the world map on the website up to date.","","Unfortunately, nothing else understood this world map, and the data format wasn't really suitable for in-game use. So stage one was to rewrite the tool that built the worldmap data from the individual map files. Then I had to get the Map Editor to understand the new format. I didn't quite get it right first time, as you can see...","","---","","http://cdn.runescape.com/assets/img/external/oldschool/2017/newsposts/2017-04-28/world-map/InitialMapEd.png","","This is Lumbridge Castle, honest. Clearly lots of things are the wrong colour, and the observant among you will have noticed that it's upside down. Still, apparently my packtool does something. After this progress was fairly rapid.","","---","","http://cdn.runescape.com/assets/img/external/oldschool/2017/newsposts/2017-04-28/world-map/NoBlending.png","","Things are roughly the right colour now (DON'T MENTION THE BRIDGE), although there's no ground blending.","","---","","http://cdn.runescape.com/assets/img/external/oldschool/2017/newsposts/2017-04-28/world-map/CastleWalls.png","","Lumbridge Castle in defensible structure shocker.","","You'll notice that we're not just drawing the ground any more, but walls have made an appearance as well. This is good, but that bridge is still pink, and there aren't any pubs :(.","","---","","http://cdn.runescape.com/assets/img/external/oldschool/2017/newsposts/2017-04-28/world-map/Mapfunctions.png","","Now we're talking. We've got map scene icons (things like the trees and bushes), and what are internally called mapfunctions, which are the circular icons that will be familiar from the minimap.","","Lumbridge Castle is disturbingly pub-free, but we should be able to see an icon for any pubs we come across. If only we could look at something beyond this 64x64 tile area...","","---","","http://cdn.runescape.com/assets/img/external/oldschool/2017/newsposts/2017-04-28/world-map/Zoomedout2.png","","There it is! The Blue Moon Inn! Plus pubs in Falador, Port Sarim, Burthorpe, and the Barbarian Village. European monks used to take their brewing pretty seriously, but the ones on Entrana don't seem to be interested.","","---","","There are still a few problems, though - the quest start icon below Draynor Manor is partly missing, the wilderness ditch seems to have caught Pink Bridge Disease, and so on.","","http://cdn.runescape.com/assets/img/external/oldschool/2017/newsposts/2017-04-28/world-map/Overview2.png","","None of these were insurmountable problems, though, and pretty soon I had the Map Editor back to where it had been, complete with map labels (writing \"Lumbridge\" somewhere near Lumbridge, etc) and an overview.","","So, we'll just stick it in the client and see how we get on shall we?","","Putting the map into the client","","http://cdn.runescape.com/assets/img/external/oldschool/2017/newsposts/2017-04-28/world-map/Client.png","","#SHIPIT","","Yes, well. \"Requires engine work.\"","","Actually, mostly it just needed some simple content work that I had no idea how to do, and with help from Mod Maz I soon had an interface in the game with the map on it, scrolling nicely.","","http://cdn.runescape.com/assets/img/external/oldschool/2017/newsposts/2017-04-28/world-map/client2.png","","At this point, the map looks dangerously close to being done, but as ever with these things, the battle was only half over. The map was scrollable and zoomable, but you couldn't interact with it in any way.","","The dream of being able to have a key for the icons where you could click on the pubs and make them flash to make finding them easier was still some way off.","","This was where the work to make the map accessible from OldSchool's scripting system needed to happen.
